## Types of ML:
### 1. Supervised: learning with labelled data
    1. Classification: predicts categorical data
    2. Regression: predicts numerical data


### 2. Unsupervised: learning with unlabelled data
    1. Clustering: groups similar data
    2. Dimensionality reduction: reduces dimensions of data without losing information
    3. Generative: generates new data points similar to dataset


### 3. Reinforcement: learning with an agent and environment
